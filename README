* Description

Object::Accessor::Inheritable

    Object::Accessor::Inheritable lets you inherit data between
    Object::Accessor::Inheritable objects by defining a relationship
    between these objects. This works analogous to perls own @ISA
    resolving, but rather than on classes, it works on objects.
    
#####################################################################

* Installation

Object::Accessor::Inheritable follows the standard perl module install 
process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required.
